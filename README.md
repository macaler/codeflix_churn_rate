# codeflix_churn_rate

This is one of several Codecademy Pro guided projects that I completed. The premise is that Codeflix, a fictional video streaming start-up, is intereted in calculating its churn rate for its two user segments.

I used SQLite to complete this project. Since the fictional data was developed and generated by Codecademy, I cannot include the database that Codecademy provided. However, to give some context to the SQL searches included in this repository, the data base included one table with an ID column, a subscription_start column, a subscription_end column, and a segment column.

I wrote a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation outlining the main results and conclusions of this project; I have included it as "churn_rate_project.pdf."

Also, a file containing the SQL searches used to gather and analyze the data in this project is provided; it is included as "churn_rate_project.sql."
